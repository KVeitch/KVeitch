As Former engineer and public school educator,  I have always been drawn to math, physics, and the science of building things. Putting all those pieces together, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. I enjoyed being an educator at charter school and a part of a small engineering firm, where I worked in a variety of team roles.  I always found myself being pulled towards technology and programming. As my professional experience grew, I began to see how I could leverage my engineering, teaching, and problem solving background in new ways. This led me to the Turing School of Software and Design where I honed the skills necessary to be part of a dynamic software development team.
